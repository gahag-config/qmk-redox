* My personal redox config
  This is the repository with everything I used to build the [[https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard][Redox]] keyboard, by Mattia Dal
  Ben. Thank you Matt, you saved my hands.
** My keyboard
   This is what my keyboard looks like:
   [[./build-log/9.done.jpg]]
** Keymap
   My current main layer keymap looks like this:
   [[./kbd-layout/kbd-layout.png]]
** How to flash
   Just run:
   #+begin_src bash
      sudo make redox/rev1:default:avrdude
   #+end_src
   and then press the reset button.

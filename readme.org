* My personal redox config
  This is the repository with everything I used to build the [[https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard][Redox]] keyboard, by Mattia Dal
  Ben. Thank you Matt, you saved my hands.
** My keyboard
   This is what my keyboard looks like:
   [[./build-log/9.done.jpg]]
** Keymap
   My current layers look like this:
   - Main:
     [[./kbd-layout/def-layer.png]]
   - Symbols:
     [[./kbd-layout/sym-layer.png]]
   - Navigation:
     [[./kbd-layout/nav-layer.png]]
** Build log
   I have written a [[./build-log/readme.org][build log]] of my keyboard, in Portuguese. This might help you in
   building your own. If you don't speak Portuguese, you can always follow the [[https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard/tree/master/redox][original
   guide]].
** How to flash
   Just run:
   #+begin_src bash
      sudo make redox/rev1:default:avrdude
   #+end_src
   and then press the reset button.
